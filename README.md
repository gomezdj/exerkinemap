# Introduction
Exerkines are biomolecules released during physical exercise that mediate various physiological responses and health benefits. ExerkineMap integrates data from multiple omics domains (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.), single-cell technologies, and spatial omics techniques to provide a holistic view of how exercise influences molecular and cellular processes.

# Key Features
* Comprehensive Data Integration: Harmonizes multiomics, single-cell, and spatial data.
* Exerkine Profiling: Identifies and characterizes exerkines and their regulatory mechanisms.
* Trajectory and Network Inference: Applies advanced methods to infer cellular trajectories and molecular networks.
* Spatial Analysis: Maps the spatial distribution of cells and molecules within tissues affected by exercise.
* Interactive Visualization: Provides tools for visualizing data through heatmaps, scatter plots, UMAP plots, and more.
* Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes state-of-the-art ML models for enhanced data analysis.
* Robust Validation and Benchmarking: Ensures accuracy and reliability through rigorous validation and benchmarking.

# Installation
To install ExerkineMap, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/ExerkineMap.git
cd ExerkineMap
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher.

# Quick Start Guide
1. Load Your Data: Ensure your multiomics, single-cell, and spatial data are formatted correctly.
2. Run Data Integration: Use the provided scripts to integrate your data.
3. Analyze and Visualize: Leverage ExerkineMapâ€™s functionalities to perform analysis and generate visualizations.

Example Usage
```
import exerkine_map as em

# Load and preprocess your data
transcriptomics_data = em.load_data("transcriptomics.csv")
proteomics_data = em.load_data("proteomics.csv")
spatial_data = em.load_spatial_data("spatial_data.csv")

# Integrate multiomics data
integrated_data = em.integrate_data([transcriptomics_data, proteomics_data])

# Run analysis
exerkine_profiles = em.identify_exerkines(integrated_data)
trajectories = em.infer_trajectories(integrated_data)
spatial_map = em.map_spatial_relationships(spatial_data, integrated_data)

# Generate visualizations
em.plot_heatmap(exerkine_profiles)
em.plot_umap(trajectories)
em.plot_spatial_map(spatial_map)
```

# Data Integration and Analysis
# Exerkine Identification
ExerkineMap identifies and characterizes exerkinesâ€”molecules released during exercise that mediate physiological effects. It uses differential expression analysis and network-based approaches to pinpoint key exerkines and their regulatory pathways.

# Trajectory Inference and Network Analysis
ExerkineMap utilizes scVelo for RNA velocity analysis and trajectory inference. This involves the following steps:
* Preprocess the data to compute RNA velocity.
* Infer trajectories using the velocity information.
* Construct molecular networks to understand signaling pathways.

```
import scvelo as scv
import scanpy as sc

# Load the data into an AnnData object
adata = sc.read("integrated_data.h5ad")

# Preprocess for RNA velocity
scv.pp.filter_and_normalize(adata)
scv.pp.moments(adata)

# Compute RNA velocity
scv.tl.velocity(adata)
scv.tl.velocity_graph(adata)

# Visualize
scv.pl.velocity_embedding_stream(adata, basis='umap')

```

# Automated Cell Annotation (scRNA-seq data)
Cell type prediction (Python class `CellAssign`) for each cell is accomplish through a generative process that uses a neative binomial mixeture model to make cell-type predcitions. The inference is computed with the expectation maximization (EM) to optimize its parameters and provides a cell-type prediction for each cell. The logic implementing CellAssign can be found in [`scvi.external.cellassign.CellAssignModule`]. The implementation uses the same variable names as the math. The core logic is implemented in `scvi.external.cellassign.CellAssignModule.generative()`. In this method, the E step is taken and the log likelihood is computed for all cell types. In `scvi.external.cellassign.CellAssignModule.loss()` the full expected log likelihood is computed, as well as as the penalities corresponding to th epriors on pi and delta. CellAssign uses the standard `TrainingPlan`. 

# Spatial Mapping
By integrating spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data, ExerkineMap provides insights into the spatial organization of cells within tissues. This helps in understanding how exercise-induced changes alter tissue architecture and cell positioning.

# Single-Cell Analysis
ExerkineMap leverages single-cell RNA sequencing and other single-cell technologies to explore cellular heterogeneity and identify cell-type-specific responses to exercise. It incorporates tools like Seurat and Scanpy for clustering, differential expression, and functional analysis.

## ðŸ§¬ Single-cell Integration
