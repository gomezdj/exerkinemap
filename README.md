* Exerkine Profiling: Identifies and characterizes exerkines and their regulatory mechanisms.
* Trajectory and Network Inference: Applies advanced methods to infer cellular trajectories and molecular networks.
* Spatial Analysis: Maps the spatial distribution of cells and molecules within tissues affected by exercise.
* Interactive Visualization: Provides tools for visualizing data through heatmaps, scatter plots, UMAP plots, and more.
* Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes state-of-the-art ML models for enhanced data analysis.
* Robust Validation and Benchmarking: Ensures accuracy and reliability through rigorous validation and benchmarking.

# Installation ðŸ§¬
To install ExerkineMap, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/ExerkineMap.git
cd ExerkineMap
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher.

# Quick Start Guide
1. Load Your Data: Ensure your multiomics, single-cell, and spatial data are formatted correctly.
2. Run Data Integration: Use the provided scripts to integrate your data.
3. Analyze and Visualize: Leverage ExerkineMapâ€™s functionalities to perform analysis and generate visualizations.

Example Usage
```
import exerkinemap as em

# Load and preprocess your data
transcriptomics_data = em.load_data("transcriptomics.csv")
proteomics_data = em.load_data("proteomics.csv")
spatial_data = em.load_spatial_data("spatial_data.csv")

# Integrate multiomics data
integrated_data = em.integrate_data([transcriptomics_data, proteomics_data])

# Run analysis
exerkine_profiles = em.identify_exerkines(integrated_data)
trajectories = em.infer_trajectories(integrated_data)
spatial_map = em.map_spatial_relationships(spatial_data, integrated_data)

# Generate visualizations
em.plot_heatmap(exerkine_profiles)
em.plot_umap(trajectories)
em.plot_spatial_map(spatial_map)
```

# Data Integration and Analysis
# Exerkine Identification
ExerkineMap identifies and characterizes exerkinesâ€”molecules released during exercise that mediate physiological effects. It uses differential expression analysis and network-based approaches to pinpoint key exerkines and their regulatory pathways.

# Trajectory Inference and Network Analysis
ExerkineMap utilizes scVelo for RNA velocity analysis and trajectory inference. This involves the following steps:
* Preprocess the data to compute RNA velocity.
* Infer trajectories using the velocity information.
* Construct molecular networks to understand signaling pathways.

```
