Data Integration and Analysis
Exerkine Identification
ExerkineMap identifies and characterizes exerkines—molecules released during exercise that mediate physiological effects. It uses differential expression analysis and network-based approaches to pinpoint key exerkines and their regulatory pathways.
Trajectory Inference and Network Analysis
ExerkineMap applies methods such as Slingshot, Monocle, and PAGA to infer cellular trajectories. It also constructs signaling and regulatory networks to understand the systemic effects of exerkines.
Spatial Mapping
By integrating spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data, ExerkineMap provides insights into the spatial organization of cells within tissues. This helps in understanding how exercise-induced changes alter tissue architecture and cell positioning.
Single-Cell Analysis
ExerkineMap leverages single-cell RNA sequencing and other single-cell technologies to explore cellular heterogeneity and identify cell-type-specific responses to exercise. It incorporates tools like Seurat and Scanpy for clustering, differential expression, and functional analysis.
Visualization
ExerkineMap includes interactive visualization tools to explore and interpret data:
Heatmaps: For differential expression analysis.
UMAP Plots: For visualizing cellular trajectories and clustering.
Network Diagrams: To illustrate molecular interactions and regulatory networks.
Spatial Maps: To depict the spatial distribution of cells and molecules.
Validation
ExerkineMap ensures the accuracy and reliability of analyses through rigorous validation methodologies, including cross-validation, permutation tests, and experimental verification (e.g., flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry).
Benchmarking and Performance
ExerkineMap includes benchmarking tools to compare its performance with existing frameworks. Key metrics include accuracy, F1 score, ARI, and computational efficiency.
